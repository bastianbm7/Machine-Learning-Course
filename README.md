# Machine-Learning-Course Assignments 📚

👋 Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is where I'll be uploading my assignments and projects completed during my machine learning course. The assignments cover a range of topics in machine learning and are organized into their own folders with instructions and information in the README file. The projects demonstrate my ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems and are also organized into their own folders with information on how to run the code.

📂 In this repository, you'll find my code, data, and documentation for each assignment and project. I hope it serves as a valuable resource for students and machine learning enthusiasts who want to learn from my work.

🔧 **Technologies used:** Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

🤝 **Contributions:**I welcome any contributions or suggestions for improving my work. If you notice any issues or errors in my code, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn from others. If you have any feedback or ideas for improvement, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request with your changes.

👋 Thank you for visiting my repository! I hope you found the information and resources here helpful.

🚀 Keep coding and learning, and best of luck with your projects! Goodbye for now! 👋
